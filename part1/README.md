# Part 1 - Introduction to React

## Exercise 1.1: course information step1
Use Vite to initialize a new application. Modify main.jsx to match the following

```React
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```

and App.jsx to match the following


```React
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = 'Fundamentals of React'
  const exercises1 = 10
  const part2 = 'Using props to pass data'
  const exercises2 = 7
  const part3 = 'State of a component'
  const exercises3 = 14

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{course}</h1>
      <p>
        {part1} {exercises1}
      </p>
      <p>
        {part2} {exercises2}
      </p>
      <p>
        {part3} {exercises3}
      </p>
      <p>Number of exercises {exercises1 + exercises2 + exercises3}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

and remove extra files App.css and index.css, and the directory assets.

Unfortunately, the entire application is in the same component. Refactor the code so that it consists of three new components: Header, Content, and Total. All data still resides in the App component, which passes the necessary data to each component using props. Header takes care of rendering the name of the course, Content renders the parts and their number of exercises and Total renders the total number of exercises.

Define the new components in the file App.jsx.

The App component's body will approximately be as follows:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  // const-definitions

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={course} />
      <Content ... />
      <Total ... />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Exercise 1.2: course information step2
Refactor the Content component so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead, it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

```jsx
const Content = ... {
  return (
    <div>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Exercise 1.3: course information step3
1.3: course information step3
Let's move forward to using objects in our application. Modify the variable definitions of the App component as follows and also refactor the application so that it still works:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = {
    name: 'Fundamentals of React',
    exercises: 10
  }
  const part2 = {
    name: 'Using props to pass data',
    exercises: 7
  }
  const part3 = {
    name: 'State of a component',
    exercises: 14
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Exercise 1.4: course information step4
And then place the objects into an array. Modify the variable definitions of App into the following form and modify the other parts of the application accordingly:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const parts = [
    {
      name: 'Fundamentals of React',
      exercises: 10
    },
    {
      name: 'Using props to pass data',
      exercises: 7
    },
    {
      name: 'State of a component',
      exercises: 14
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

NB at this point you can assume that there are always three items, so there is no need to go through the arrays using loops. We will come back to the topic of rendering components based on items in arrays with a more thorough exploration in the next part of the course.

However, do not pass different objects as separate props from the App component to the components Content and Total. Instead, pass them directly as an array:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  // const definitions

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={course} />
      <Content parts={parts} />
      <Total parts={parts} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Exercise 1.5: course information step5
Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
